# Gotic

A modern static site generator written in Go.

## Overview

Gotic is a command-line tool for creating and managing static websites. It provides a simple interface to scaffold new site projects with a well-organized directory structure.

## Features

- **Project Scaffolding**: Quickly create new static site projects with organized directory structure
- **CLI Interface**: Clean command-line interface built with Cobra and BubbleTea
- **Directory Management**: Automatically creates essential directories (pages, styles, assets)
- **Go-powered**: Fast and efficient, built with Go

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hammadmajid/gotic.git
cd gotic
go build -o gotic ./cmd/gotic
```

### Using Go Install

```bash
go install github.com/hammadmajid/gotic/cmd/gotic@latest
```

## Usage

### Create a New Site

Create a new static site project:

```bash
# Create a site with a specific name
gotic new my-awesome-site

# Create a site with default name (my-site)
gotic new
```

This will create a new directory with the following structure:

```txt
my-awesome-site/
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/      # Markdown pages and content
â”œâ”€â”€ styles/     # CSS stylesheets
â””â”€â”€ assets/     # Images, fonts, and other static assets
```

### Help

Get help for any command:

```bash
gotic --help
gotic new --help
```

## Project Structure

The generated project follows a conventional structure:

- **`pages/`** - Contains your markdown pages and content files
- **`styles/`** - CSS stylesheets for styling your site
- **`assets/`** - Static assets like images, fonts, JavaScript files
